This file is part of the sample code for the article,
"What is Jetty,"
http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/06/14/what-is-jetty.html
by Ethan McCallum

This code was tested against Jetty 5.1.10 and Sun's JDK 1.5.0_03.


To launch the samples you must first edit the files .classpath (for Eclipse)
and/or launch_jetty.sh (for *nix shell) to reflect the location of your Jetty
install.
